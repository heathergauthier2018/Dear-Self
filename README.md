🌸 Dear Self — A Soft & Mindful Journaling Experience

A beautifully designed React journaling application focused on presence, emotional safety, and intentional reflection. Dear Self provides daily affirmations, a calm writing space, customizable themes, mood tracking (future), and an atmospheric journaling environment inspired by soft pastels, watercolor textures, and paper-like UI.

Dear Self is not a productivity tool.
It is a sanctuary — a quiet place for reflection.
